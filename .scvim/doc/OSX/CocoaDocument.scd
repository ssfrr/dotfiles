CocoaDocument

CocoaDocument implements Document functionality for the SuperCollider user interface on Mac OSX.

You could instantiate it e.g. by running CocoaDocument.new but in order to write platform-independent code you should not do thisâ€”simply call Document.new and this instantiates the correct class for your system.

For examples and method descriptions see Document.
