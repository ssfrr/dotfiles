Post			posts text to the post window

Inherits from: Object

The class Post is a stream destination.

a = "a string";
b = 'a symbol';
c = 4;
d = [1,2,3,4,a,b];

// post as string
Post << a << Char.nl;
// post as compile string
Post <<< a << Char.nl;

// post as string
Post << d << Char.nl;
// post as compile string
Post <<< d << Char.nl;

This is the equivalent of :
d.postln;
or
d.asCompileString.postln;



Its main use is that it can sometimes make code more readable and execution slightly more efficient.

Post <<< a << " " <<< b << " " <<< c << " " <<< d << Char.nl;
vs.
(a.asCompileString + b.asCompileString + c.asCompileString + d.asCompileString).postln;

Warning:
	<< also means object left shift
