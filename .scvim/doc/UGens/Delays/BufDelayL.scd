BufDelayL	buffer based simple delay line with linear interpolation

BufDelayL.ar(buf, in, delaytime, mul, add)
BufDelayL.kr(buf, in, delaytime, mul, add)

Simple delay line with linear interpolation which uses a buffer for its internal memory. See also BufDelayN which uses no interpolation, and BufDelayC which uses cubic interpolation. Cubic interpolation is more computationally expensive than linear, but more accurate.

buf - buffer number.
in - the input signal.
delaytime - delay time in seconds.
Warning: For reasons of efficiency, the effective 
buffer size is limited to the previous power of two. So, if 44100 
samples are allocated, the maximum delay would be 32768 samples.


// allocate buffer
b = Buffer.alloc(s,44100,1);

(
// Dust randomly triggers Decay to create an exponentialÂ 
// decay envelope for the WhiteNoise input source
{
z = Decay.ar(Dust.ar(1,0.5), 0.3, WhiteNoise.ar);
BufDelayL.ar(b, z, 0.2, 1, z); // input is mixed with delay via the add input
}.play
