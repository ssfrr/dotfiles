BLowPass4	24db/oct rolloff - 4th order resonant Low Pass Filter. [1]

BLowPass4.ar(in, freq, rq, mul, add)

in - input signal to be processed
freq - cutoff frequency.
rq - the reciprocal of Q.Â  bandwidth / cutoffFreq.

The B equalization suite is based on the Second Order Section (SOS) biquad UGen.

note: Biquad coefficient calculations imply certain amount of CPU overhead. These plugin UGens contain optimizations such that the coefficients get updated only when there has been a change to one of
the filter's parameters. This can cause spikes in CPU performance and should be considered when using several of these units.

[1] this is a composite pseudo UGen. BLowPass4 is built by cascading 2 SOS sections.
